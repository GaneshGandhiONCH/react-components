# React Components Catalog

Inspired by the [awesome-react-components](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components) but lists only the components I or [contributors](https://github.com/sapegin/react-components/graphs/contributors) use themeselves and can recommend. I believe 15 date picker components for React can’t be awesome and you still have no idea which one you should use.

## UI components

### Component libraries

- [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) — great project but the CSS is from original Bootstrap, so never use in a project with custom design.
- [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) — components that implement Google’s Material Design.
- [semantic-ui-react](http://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) — framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts.

### Select

- [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) — filtering, multiple selection, etc.

### Date/time picker

- [react-day-picker](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker) — flexible date picker.

### Autocomplete

- [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) — WAI-ARIA compliant.

### Autosize textarea

- [react-textarea-autosize](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-textarea-autosize) — replacement for the textarea element which automatically resizes textarea as content changes.

### Masked input

- [react-input-mask](https://github.com/sanniassin/react-input-mask) — input masking with attention to small usability details with cursor position, copy-paste, etc.

### Rich text and code editing

- [react-codemirror2](https://github.com/scniro/react-codemirror2) — CodeMirror component.

### Markdown

See [#1](https://github.com/sapegin/react-components/issues/1) for discussion.

- [simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) — very small (4 KB, ~10 times smaller than alternatives), no HTML support.
- [markdown-to-jsx](https://probablyup.github.io/markdown-to-jsx/) — a simple-markdown fork with HTML support, GFM task lists and syntax highlight.

### Tables
